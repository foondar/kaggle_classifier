This is a project I worked on four years ago while recovering from an accident. It was used to participate in the Kaggle
Wikipedia challenge. It was under development when I stopped working on it, so some things aren't in the best order
right now. Since then I've become a big advocate of TDD and SCRUM style development with working builds at the end of
each iteration.

It is an implementation of Genetic Programming using Java. The basic idea is to generate a population of random
programs using a set of operations, then run them through a series of competitive iterations. After each iteration, the
best performing programs are selected, some are mutated, some are cross-bred with each other, then another iteration is
run. At the end of either a set number of generations, or after a performance threshold is reached, the best program is
selected and can then be used as a classifier.
